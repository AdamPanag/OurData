## Hello World
One greeting, one name. "Hello World". This is a project for university, and it is the first big step for us, to the world of Programming. :space_invader:

## Functions
This project is about a data base. It gives the opportunity to the user to add, edit and delete fields in the data base. Also, the user can create, handle and present multiple tables (arrays). Below, we explain how the system works.

## How it works
Firstly, pop-ups the main menu with the following orders:
***0. Terminate Application*** , where you shut down the application.
***1. Create a table*** , where you create a table in your Data Base.
***2. Edit an existing table*** , where you can do changes in an existing table at your Data Base.
***3. Print all tables*** , where you print all the tables you have created, with their fields and categories.

If you choose 1, then you will need to give a name to the table you are going to create. After that, a second pop-up menu shows up with all the things you can do. From that point, you will be able to start setting up your own data base.

***0. Go back*** :small_blue_diamond:
By pressing 0, you select to go back and you will be transfered in the main menu again.

***1. Add categories*** :small_blue_diamond:
By pressing 1, you order to create a category in which you may later add fields if you choose. After giving the name of your first category, you have two options:
- First, you can create again another category, by pressing 1 and giving a name. You can make as many categories as you choose to.
- Second, you can stop making more categories, by pressing any other button from 1, and go to the previous menu.

***2. Add fields*** :small_blue_diamond:
By pressing 2, you choose to create a field in the existing categories. Provided only you have created at least one category, you can insert a field. If you have not created a category earlier, the system automatically leads you to do. You can continue adding fields by pressing 1 when the corresponding input shows up.

***3. Delete fields*** :small_blue_diamond:
By pressing 3, you select to delete all fields in a specific line for all categories. You just have to choose which line you want to delete. But if you have not created any fields, then you follow the procedure of adding fields (Function 2). 

***4. Edit fields*** :small_blue_diamond:
By pressing 4, you order to edit the name of the field you want. To manage to do that, you have to choose the line and the category that corresponds to the field you want to rename. If the line or the category you typed have not been created yet, you will need to type again. You must have created at least one field to be able to edit, or else the system will lead you to the procedure of adding fields (Function 2).

***5. Edit categories*** :small_blue_diamond:
By pressing 5, you select to give a new name to an existing category. You must type the exact name of the category that you want to rename. Elsewere, you will need to type again if the name is wrong.

***6. Print the table*** :small_blue_diamond:
By pressing 6, you choose to print the table that you have made. It prints to the console the name of the table, the categories with their fields, and the number of each line.

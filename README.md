## Hello World
One greeting, one name. "Hello World". This is a project for university, and it is the first big step for us, to the world of Programming. :space_invader:  :hotsprings:

## How it works
This project is about a data base. It gives the opportunity to the user, to do the basic functions of a data base. Below, we explain how the system works.

Firstly, pop-ups the main menu with the following orders:
***0. Terminate Application*** , where you can shut down the application.
***1. Create a Data Base*** , where you can create a new data base.
***2. Edit an existing Data Base*** , where you can do changes in an existing data base.

If you choose 1, then you will need to give a name to the data base you are going to create. After that, a second pop-up menu shows up with all the things you can do. From that point, you will be able to start set up your own data base.

***0. Go back***
If you select to go back, you will be transfered in the main menu again.

***1. Add categories***
By pressing 1, you order to create a category in which you may later add fields if you choose. After giving the name of your first category, you have two options: -First, you can create again another category, by pressing 1 and giving a name. You can make as many categories as you choose to.
         -Second, you can stop making more categories, by pressing any other button from 1, and go to the previous menu.
